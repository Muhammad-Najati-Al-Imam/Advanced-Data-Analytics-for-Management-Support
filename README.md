**Overview**
###
The module Advanced Data Analytics for Management Support (ADAMS) introduces students to the latest developments in the scope of data-driven management support. It covers relevant theories and concepts in machine learning against the background of concrete real-world applications in management science. Special emphasize is given to the analysis of textual data and other forms of complex data such as sequences or images. Corresponding data is typically approached using the framework of deep artificial neural networks. The module recognizes the importance of deep learning and elaborates on corresponding methodologies. Frameworks and practices to use advanced (deep) machine learning technology and deploy corresponding solutions are of critical importance and will be elaborated in tutorial sessions.

The topics covered in the module include but are not limited to:

* Fundamentals of artificial neural networks
* Recurrent and convolutional neural networks for sequential data processing
* Fundamentals of natural language processing(NLP)
* Text embedding and language models
* Sentiment Analysis
* Approaches for NLP transfer learning
###
The module is designed as a follow-up to the module Business Analytics and Data Science (BADS). We expect students to have completed that module prior to taking ADAMS. More specifically, it is strongly recommended to join this module with a solid understanding of  (supervised) machine learning practices and algorithms. Some experience in Python programming is also expected since we use the Python programming language in tutorials. The grading of the module will be based on a practical assignment, which also involves Python programming.

**Assignment Description**
###
The learning goal of the module is to familiarize you with recent developments in deep learning and to enable you to use the corresponding methodology for solving real-world problems. In accordance with this objective, the evaluation of the module is based on an assignment.

Your submission will consist of a Jupyter notebook that includes all steps that we typically encounter in a machine learning pipeline (explanatory data analysis, data preparation, parameter tuning, etc.). Grading of the notebook will be based on several criteria including the quality of the exposition, organization, whether your notebook displays a sensible mix of code, explanation, and mathematical formalism, quality of your programming codes, and obviously whether you have solved the task in a sound and rigorous manner. Blog posts like those you find on platforms such as towardsdatascience.com, machinelearningmastery.com, and the like can give you a feeling of what is expected.
